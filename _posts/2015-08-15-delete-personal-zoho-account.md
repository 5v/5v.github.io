Deleting a Zoho account is not a simple one-step process. It *is* however
logical, so the full deletion steps (for a single-user with a domain email
account) are as follows:

1. Go to [mail.zoho.com][]{:target="blank"}
2. Hit [Control Panel -> Mail & Docs][control panel]
3. Go to the domains tab
   * Click the button to remove mail hosting for the organisation domain
     (envelope and arrow)
   * Click "OK" on the pop up
   * Click the rightmost button to delete the domain (X)
   * Type your admin password and hit, "Yes Delete Now"
4. Go to the dashboard tab
   * Hit "Delete Orgnisation"
   * Enter your admin password again at the prompt
   * Ignore redirect to page to create an organisation
5. Goto [accounts.zoho.com][]{:target="blank"}
   * Click the preferences icon
   * Go to the "Close Account" tab
   * Enter your admin password again and click, "Close Account"
   * Click "OK" on the "Are you sure" dialogue.

This is here as the couple of times I have done this, I've basically started at
**5**, looked at the error which has taken me to **4** and so on until I get the
order right.
