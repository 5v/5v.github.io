I've been a vim user for quite a long time. On more than one occasion I have
attempted to have a proper try at grasping the basics of emacs, and have
repeatedly failed. Today however was different â€“ I have been using emacs all
evening and it is now configured in a way that I would consider more-or-less
sane.

With `vim`, one can insert a unicode symbol in `INSERT` mode by using `ctrl+v`
then `u` and then typing the unicode character sequence (e.g. `f00c`).

In `emacs`, the equivalent is `C-x 8 RET f00c RET` (where `RET` is pressing
return). Job done.
