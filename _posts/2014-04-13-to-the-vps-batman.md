A new server and a new home – a refreshing move from shared hosting to a VPS.

After a brief fling with a number of flat-file website platforms, I find myself
once again back on WordPress. The motive behind looking elsewhere was to find
something lighter, since I don’t use many features and I dislike using software
that I am not using completely (or thereabouts).

The lightweight part was also important due to the nature of my shiny new VPS.
A mind-bendingly speedy server weighing in with a whole 256 MB of RAM! That
said, it has been performing splendidly so far. In the unlikely event of any
period of high-traffic, I suspect it will turn around and go for a nap, but
that’s part of the fun :)

Now it is up and running nicely, the next step is to bring in some of my old
posts; where by “bring in” I mean more-or-less rewrite. I will try to fiddle
the dates so they correspond to when they were originally posted however.

As ever, most of the things I write about here I do so partially so I can
remember them myself, but also assuming that I am not going to be the first or
only person to come accross a given problem and that my ramblings may one day
be of use to someone.

Hopefully that will be the case...
